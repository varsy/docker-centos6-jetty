docker-centos6-jetty
====================

CentOS6 + jetty v9.3.11 inside.

You should create your new containers based on this image. 
Just put your context to `/home/jetty/jetty-current/contexts/` and war file to `/home/jetty/jetty-current/webapps/`.
Of course you could tune this jetty as you want :-)
